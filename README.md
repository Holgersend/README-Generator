## Description
As a developer, I often need to quickly create professional README files for new projects. I've created a command-line application that generates high-quality README.md files based on user input. This application allows me to focus more on the project itself and less on the README formatting.

## Installation 

1- Clone this repository to your local machine. [gh repo clone Holgersend/README-Generator](https://github.com/Holgersend/README-Generator.git)
2- Navigate to the project's root directory in the command line.
3- Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.

# Usage 
In the command-line interface, navigate to the project's root directory.
Run the application by entering the command node index.js.
Follow the prompts and provide information about your project when prompted.
Once all information is entered, the application will generate a README.md file in the root directory of your project.

# License 
This application is covered under the MIT license.
